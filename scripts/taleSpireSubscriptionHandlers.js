 * 1. Triggers the loading of global settings for our plugin.
 * 2. Does not directly call checkAndUpgradeRollsData, as this is now handled
 *    within loadRollsFromLocalStorage to ensure proper sequencing.

 * processes occur in the correct order, preventing any attempts to use
 * data before it has been properly loaded and, if necessary, upgraded.

/**
 * Checks if the saved rolls data needs to be upgraded and performs the upgrade if necessary.
 * Includes a backup mechanism to preserve original data in case of upgrade failure.
 * 
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Loads existing data from local storage.
 * 2. Creates a backup of the original data before any modifications.
 * 3. Checks if the data is in the old format (1.3) and needs upgrading.
 * 4. If an upgrade is needed, it converts the data to the new format (2.0).
 * 5. Saves the upgraded data and logs the process.
 * 6. In case of failure, attempts to restore the original data.
